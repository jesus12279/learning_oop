First Steps in learning object oriented programming using python.

This is a repository that has been created to explore the world of object orinted programming,
i am taking my first steps into classes, instances, and child classes, etc.


One of my first classes will be to take in user names and return a well fomatted name,
i will also be taking the time to dive in to unit testing using unittest from pythons built in funcitons.


Feel free to clone this repository if you are as well like me, learning to code python and need some 
ideas to play around with. 





"""""FYI this repository is a test phase, subject to future changes in topic""""
